# check which variables have NA values (to pay special attention to later). TAKEAWAY: it looks like iso3c, region, capital, longitude, latitude, income, and lending has the same numbers of missing rows, and SH.STA.BASS.ZS has MANY missing rows (which makes sense based on the View() call earlier, it looks like most countries only have sanitation data starting in 2000)

sapply(sanitation, function(x) unique(x))

# inspect NA rows for non-SH.STA.BASS.ZS columns. TAKEAWAY: among the 180 cases that have NA values, there are three "countries" (under the country column): "Sub-Saharan Africa", "Latin America & Caribbean", and "North Macedonia". For "Sub-Saharan Africa" and "Latin America & Caribbean", I could later filter them out, as they should have "Aggregates" under the region column, but instead they are having NAs. I think this may be a mistake in the server. For "North Macedonia", I believe it should be a mistake to have NA under the region column (should be "Europe & Central Asia"), and NA under the income column (should be "Upper middle income", based on the 2019 income level definition in the "CLASS.xls" file (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/CLASS.xls) downloaded on June 19 2020 from this page (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups)). I will need to update the NA values for North Macedonia later.

The following code first removes the NA rows in SH.STA.BASS.ZS, and then check for each country if the number of rows are the same as (last avaiable year - first avaiable year + 1). If they are the same it means there are no gaps. In other words, there's only trailing and leading NA rows, which will be removed safely and no interpolation would be needed. TAKEAWAY: The code returns zero (no rows), which means there's no need to do interpolation later.

<!-- Begin write-up -->
## <span>Introduction</span>
Sanitation is fundamental to human development. Safely managed sanitation services can reduce diarrheal disease, and can significantly lessen the adverse health impacts of other disorders. 

Using data from the [WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene](https://washdata.org/) obtained through the [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/), I created a chart below about the [indicator](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.BASS.ZS) "people using at least basic sanitation services (as a percent of the population)" for 191 countries around the world from 2000 to 2017. 

## <span>How to read the chart</span>
Each circle represents one country. The 191 countries are categorized into [four income groups](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups) based on the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita in 2018. The X-axis indicates the percentage of the country's population that uses at least basic sanitation services. The [density estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation) are drawn for each group and reflect the distribution of countries.

As the year progresses, the circles move along the X-axis. The color of the circle indicates whether the indicator in that country has <span class="red">decreased</span>, <span class="orange">stayed the same</span>, or <span class="green">increased</span> from 2000 to 2017. As the circles move, the distribution of countries reshapes.


<!-- Show animation -->
![](GIFOutput/sanitation-compressed.gif)


## <span>Takeaways</span>

- From 2000 to 2017, most countries have experienced an increase in the share of the population using at least basic sanitation services, as indicated by most circles and the distribution of circles moving to the right.

- The share of the population using at least basic sanitation services varies by income groups at any given year between 2000 and 2017. High income countries have nearly universal access to at least basic sanitation services while most low income countries have less than half of their population with the same access.

- The rate of change in the share of the population using at least basic sanitation services also differs by income group. As the high income countries have limited room for improvement, they generally exhibit a constant level of access. In comparison, countries in the upper middle income, lower middle income, and low income groups experience a higher rate of change in this indicator, as indicated by the faster speed of circles moving to the right.

- Against the overall trend, a handful of countries experienced a decrease in the percentage of the population, which calls for special attention.


## <span>Further analysis ideas</span>
Further analysis could investigate other non-income factors that may explain the gap in the share of the population using at least basic sanitation services. Case studies of the outlier countries that have the largest increase or decrease would reveal insights on what is needed to improve the sanitation situations around the world.


## <span>Source and method</span>
The 191 countries represented in the chart are the countries that have data for all years between 2000 and 2017. The list of countries and more information could be seen below. The term country does not imply political independence but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics.

The indicator on sanitation is produced by the Joint Monitoring Programme of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) based on administrative sources, national censuses and nationally representative household surveys. WHO/UNICEF defines safely managed sanitation facilities as improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite. Improved sanitation facilities include flush/pour flush to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines: ventilated improved pit latrines, compositing toilets or pit latrines with slabs.
